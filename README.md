#Bluetooth Server with BME280 Sensor Integration and Digital System Control
Project Description:
Enhanced a Bluetooth server to display pressure readings from a BME280 sensor on the connected client. Additionally, developed a digital system modeled with one LED on the client that can be controlled (ON/OFF) using a push button on the enhanced server.

Aim:
To augment the functionality of a Bluetooth server by integrating pressure monitoring capabilities and adding a remotely controllable digital system, thereby providing users with real-time sensor data and enhanced control over connected devices for improved operational efficiency.

Results:
Successfully implemented an enhanced Bluetooth server that displays real-time pressure readings from a BME280 sensor on the connected client. Users can control an LED on the client using a push button on the server, allowing for efficient monitoring and control of the system.
